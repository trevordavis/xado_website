								<h2 class="major">About X.ado</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/reunion.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>X.ado is Dartmouth College's co-ed, Christian a cappella group. Founded in 1992, we've spent 25 years sharing the good news of Christ through music. Our repertoire ranges from gospel to choral to pop, and our venues range from Dartmouth fraternities to churches to locations like Seattle, WA or Seoul, South Korea on our annual tour!</p>

								<br><br><br>
								<h2 class="major">X.ado's Purpose</h2>
								<p>*X.ado's Purpose*

									X.ado exists as both a performing a cappella group and a ministry on Dartmouth's campus.  Externally, we strive to use the voices, senses of humor, and the other talents that we believe God has given us, in order to glorify Him and to spread the message of the love and salvation that can be found through Christ.  Internally, we strive to work together in making music, and to encourage each other in our spiritual walks, daily grind of Dartmouth living, and really all aspects of life.

									We are constantly seeking to love God more, to love each other more, and to share the hope given to us by that amazing love that has found each of us.

								</p>

								<br><br><br>
								<h2 class="major">X.ado's Story</h2>
								<p>
									Written in Fall 1998 by Jeff Cummins '98

									This page is here because the story of what has happened to X.ado at Dartmouth is the story of God's faithfulness to a handful of college students, of the power of the Holy Spirit, and the power of prayer to open doors that were not only closed, but were never even imagined. <br><br>
									 
									A cappella has always been a big deal at Dartmouth.  There are men's groups, women's groups, co-ed groups, barbershop groups, doo-wop groups, and on and on.  A cappella concerts are huge, almost always packed out of the fraternity basements and dorm lounges they're held in. <br><br>
									 
									In 1992, a group of Christian '94s, '95s, and '96s who enjoyed music and had a desire to share the gospel with the Dartmouth campus decided to bring their message to the a cappella scene.  They called their group Xado, which they had been told was an ancient Greek word meaning "Praising God Together."  The group had seven members, male and female, and lasted for about a year.  Scott Lawrence '95 was the pitch of the group.  They gave a concert in winter term '93, but then gradually faded away. <br><br>
									 
									But the vision did not die away.  Steve Park '98 felt a desire to see Christian a cappella at Dartmouth, and he, Mi Ryung An '96, who had been in the original Xado, and Judy Yi '97 decided to do something about it.  And so in winter '95, Xado was refounded, and the present group came into existence.  Six '98s, two '97s, a '96 and Grad student were the founding members.  Xado performed a few concerts on campus and, as a highlight of the year, sang at Gospel Jam '95 at Yale. <br><br>
									 
									Unfortunately, a bit of Greek research by Josh Chuang '98 revealed that Xado did not mean what we thought it meant.  Apparently, it meant nothing at all.  Although this was better than it meaning something inapprorpriate, we felt that it was time to find a new name.  A few possibilities such as TGFKAX (The Group Formerly Known As Xado), the Dartmouth S.O.U.L, and Generation Cross were suggested.  Fortunately, perhaps, none stuck. <br><br>
									 
									In the end, however, the problem was solved.  Although Xado doesn't mean anything, the word "Ado" means "to sing to" or "sing praises to."  We decided that the X stood for Xristos -- Jesus Christ, and added the period to our name.  And so now we say, "Ado" means to sing for, and the X stands for Christ.  As do we. <br><br>
									 
									'95-'96 was a growth year for X.ado.  People seemed to be constantly coming and going, and too busy to devote as much time as they wanted to the group.  We struggled with discipline, we struggled with personality conflicts, and we struggled with music.  But God was faithful.  He carried us through. <br><br>
									 
									The fall of '96 looked at first like it might see the end of X.ado.  The '96s had graduated, and every one of the '98s were either off campus or too busy to sing.  And so, to begin the third year, 5 people started out, feeling like they had to rebuild X.ado from scratch again. <br><br>
									 
									However, though we may forget it all too often, God is able to do immeasurably more than we can ever ask or imagine.  Not only did X.ado survive the year of '96-'97, we thrived.  In the fall, God opened a door for us, and through prayer, a lot of effort, and not a few miraculous provisions, we did the unimaginable.  Gospel Jam '97 was held at Dartmouth College on April 4 and 5, 1997.  X.ado sang as much in the term following as we had in the whole year before. <br><br>
									 
									The summer of '97 was a chance for us to catch up with everything that has happened with us in the past year.  We concentrated on arranging new music and finding a clearer vision for ourselves and the Dartmouth campus.  In the meantime, we enjoyed the fellowship of the group of singers that has become a band of friends.  Of course, life is never without its ups and downs (and waterfalls...) <br><br>
									 
									God did amazing things with X.ado yet again in the fall of '97.  We entered the term with 7 members, 5 of them men, and at our auditions God blessed us with 7 more.  (parable of the talents...?) It was like we were a brand new group, which brought us all the excitement of beginnings, as well as their troubles.  By God's blessing, we were able to do things we would never have dreamed of last year.  We hosted Columbia's Jubilation! and Rutgers' First Light at Dartmouth for our fall concert. <br><br>
									 
									And over winter break in 1997, we went on tour for the first time.  X.ado toured Boston for four days, singing in hospitals, on the street, at a college, and joining with MIT's Cross Products for fellowship and joint events.  We ended up at Harvard for Under Construction's Christmas Jam.  Four years ago, when a few people got together and decided to form a Christian a cappella group at Dartmouth, they never imagined we would come so far so fast.  God is faithful. <br><br>
									 
									In March 1997, we had a real tour.  We flew to California, and we sang at high schools, churches, college campuses, and on the streets.  We bonded in ways we didn't expect, and were surprised at how many people we could squeeze into Peter's car.  Our Father blessed us with beautiful weather for an entire week (it started raining as soon as we left for the airport!), appreciative audiences, and the privilege of helping a friend we met to return to his Lord and ours.  We felt that God had established us. <br><br>
									 
									We went to Gospel Jam '98 at Mount Holyoke College on a spiritual high, thrilled about God's working in us, and excited to bring His message.  But then in Spring '98, we came again to the trial.  The unity we had felt in the beginning of the year had cracked somewhere, and people felt like they were falling through those cracks.  We struggled with issues that people could never seem to make each other understand, and sometimes seemed as though we were standing on the edge of collapse.  But our Father loves us, and has plans for us, even when we wander away from Him.  We struggled in our hearts and in our discussions, and Jesus carried us all the times we couldn't see Him.  And in the end, we survived. <br><br>
									 
									And so we begin Fall '98 ready to start afresh.  We have been exalted, and we have been humbled, but the place we desire to be is in our Lord's hands.  This one thing we do: "forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, we press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called us Heavenward in Christ Jesus."  (Philippians 3:13-14).  We have asked God to bring some of you with us in our journey, and we trust He will lead you on.<br><br>

									***<br>

									The above was written 20 years ago and still rings true today. Year after year, God continues to be faithful to X.ado and use us as He sees fit. Additionally, we owe so much to all of the people who have continued to support us through the years. X.ado is still going strong, and that is because of God and what God has done through you!
